By: `Team CS2103T-F13-3`      Since: `Sep 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up


=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.moneygowhere.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Documentation#Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-3/main/blob/master/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F13-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:https://github.com/ay1920s1-cs2103t-f13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, Section 2.1 Architecture>>.


== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SpendingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SpendingBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Spending).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Spending Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Spending>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Spending Book`, which `Spending` can reference. This would allow `Spending Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Spending` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/moneygowhere/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Spending Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.moneygowhere.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Statistics feature
==== Current Implementation
For the current `statistics` feature, there are 2 main commands that the user can execute.

1. `stats` - display statistics for all spending
2. `stats d/DATE_START d/DATE_END` - display statistics for spending within a date range

The `StatsCommandParser` differentiates these 2 commands based on whether a valid date range is provided as illustrated in the diagram below.

.Activity Diagram showing behaviour of StatsCommandParser
image::statsactivitydiagram.png[width="600"]

The implementation of the Statistics feature can be split into 2 phases, preparation and execution. Given below is an explanation of how the Statistics mechanism behaves at each phase.

===== Preparation

During the preparation phase, the program parses the command for Statistics and prepares to open a new Statistics Window.
The following sequence diagram shows how `stats d/01/01/2019 d/07/01/2019` works during the preparation phase.

.Sequence Diagram demonstrating the preparation stage of Statistics feature
image::StatsSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. User executes `stats d/01/01/2019 d/07/01/2019` to generate statistics for spending within `01/01/2019` and `07/01/2019`.

2. SpendingBookParser will parse and identify the command as a StatsCommand and pass on the argument `d/ 01/01/2019 d/07/01/2019` to StatsCommandParser.

3. StatsCommandParser will check whether the date range parameters provided are valid.

4. `StatsCommand#execute()` is executed, returning a message which tells the user that the Stats Window will be opened and set a boolean `isShowStats` = true to indicate that a new window to display the statistics will be opened.

===== Execution

In the execution phase, the program processes and retrieves the data to be displayed and finally displaying it.

There are 2 types of data that the program require, `statsMessage` for displaying the statistics in text and `statsData` for displaying the data in a piechart.
Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation for the retrieval of `statsData`. `statsMessage` is retrieved in the same manner.

.Sequence Diagram of Execution Phase showing retrieving of `statsData`
image::StatsMessageSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. Upon checking that the boolean `isShowStats` = true, the MainWindow calls `LogicManager#getStatsData()`.

2. SpendingBookParser will parse and identify the command as a StatsCommand and pass on the argument `d/ 01/01/2019 d/07/01/2019` to StatsCommandParser.

3. StatsCommandParser will check whether the date range parameters provided are valid.

4. `StatsCommand#getStatsData()` is executed. Spending with date range within `01/01/2019` and `07/01/2019` is filtered.
The filtering is done through a predicate parameter which checks through the dates of the spending in the application.

5. Finally, the `statsData` will be displayed on the Ui through `StatsWindow#loadData()` call.

==== Design Considerations

===== How to pass statistics data parameters from Logic to UI

Alternative 1 (current choice): UI gets all data and parameters from Logic, which gets data from Model.

Pros: Easy to implement. Aligned with architecture.

Cons: A lot of method calls

Alternative 2: Pass data and parameters through event

Pros: Less method calls. Easier to read.

Cons: Not in alignment with architecture. Need to consider application startup when there are no events posted.

Alternative 1 was chosen due to the ease of implementation.
As the current statistics feature does not require a large amount of data, the number of method calls is not too large.
Alternative 2 requires a change in the architecture which may result in higher complexity.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSpendingBook`.
It extends `SpendingBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `spendingBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSpendingBook#commit()` -- Saves the current spending book state in its history.
* `VersionedSpendingBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous spending book state from its history.
* `VersionedSpendingBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone spending book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, `Model#undoSpendingBook()` and `Model#redoSpendingBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSpendingBook` will be initialized with the initial spending book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single spending book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th Spending in the spending book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, causing the modified state of the spending book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `spendingBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted spending book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new Spending. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, causing another modified spending book state to be saved into the `spendingBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, so the spending book state will not be saved into the `spendingBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the Spending was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#spendingBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous spending book state, and restores the spending book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial spending book state, then there are no previous spending book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSpendingBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoSpendingBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the spending book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `spendingBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest spending book state, then there are no undone spending book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSpendingBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the spending book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSpendingBook()`, `Model#undoSpendingBook()` or `Model#redoSpendingBook()`. Thus, the `SpendingBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSpendingBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `SpendingBookStateList`, all spending book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire spending book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the Spending being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of spending book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedSpendingBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


[[Implementation-Find]]
=== Find feature

The find feature allows the user to search for a spending based on specified field. If search results are too broad, fields may be combined to increase specificity.

For example, `find n/Apple c/2.50-3.00` will find an `Apple` of cost range `2.00` to `3.00`.

==== Implementation

Find is supported by having a `Predicate` implemented for every field in Spending. Predicates are added based on valid input entered by the user.

The `FindCommandParser` class stores these predicates, which are combined using Java 8 streams with an `AND` operation to form a more specific search query.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `find` command is executed:

.Sequence diagram for an example find command
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[Find Sequence Diagram]

NOTE: The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when the user uses the `find` command:

.Activity diagram for an example find command
image::FindActivityDiagram.png[Find Activity Diagram]

==== Design Considerations

[width="90%", cols="1,2,2", options="header",]
|===
|Aspect |Alternative 1 |Alternative 2

|How find is executed
|Save all predicates to a list +
Pros: Easy to implement +
Cons: All fields require a predicate
|Search the underlying list directly without using a predicate +
Pros: Able to manipulate object easily +
Cons: Poor abstraction

|===

[[Implementation-Sort]]
=== Sort feature

The sort feature allows users to sort all currently displayed Spending entries automatically. The default sorting sequence is by Date, followed by Cost. Both are in descending order.

The user may choose to modify how the displayed entries are sorted using the `sort` command.

For example, `sort n/ASC d/DESC` applies sorting by name in ascending order, followed by Date in descending order. This applies to any future commands entered.

==== Implementation

The sorting feature is supported by `SpendingComparator`, a custom comparator to facilitate different sort ordering, and implements the following operation:

* `updateSortedSpendingList(comparator)` -- Updates the sorted spending list with a new comparator.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateSortedSpendingList(comparator)`.

At a high level view, `SpendingComparator` and `SortField` interacts in the manner shown below.

.High-level view of package interaction

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `sort` command is executed:

Pros: Easy to implement +
Cons: Minor structure changes

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder feature

With this reminder feature, users can set the reminders of their tasks with deadlines and delete them when completed.

==== Implementation

A reminder is constructed with

* Deadline `d/DATE`
* Reminder Message `m/MESSAGE`

The recorded reminders sorted with deadline in descending order, are displayed on the User Interface(UI) for notification.

This feature is implemented with the following operations:

* Adding a reminder `reminder d/DATE m/MESSAGE` +
e.g. `reminder d/30/08/2020 m/Pay school fee` - set reminder to pay school fee by 30th of August 2020

* Deleting a reminder `dreminder INDEX` +
e.g. `dreminder 1` - delete the first reminder in the reminder list shown in UI.

Below is the activity diagram describing the steps take by MoneyGoWhere when it receives `AddReminderCommand`.

Figure 14. Sequence diagram while user attempt to remove a reminder

[NOTE]
The above diagram also highlights how logic and model components interact with each other while deleting a reminder.

=== Import Feature
==== Implementation
The Import feature allows our users to import data from a comma-separated values (`.csv`) files.
It allows users who would like to add their spending in bulk.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("import p/validSpending.csv")`

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `import` Command
image::importSequenceDiagram.png[]

//When a user gives an `import` command, the application will start processing the request by calling the `LogicManager`.
//It will then call the `SpendingBookParser`, which parses the command string.
//It then creates and calls the respective command parser, which in this case is `ImportCommandParser`.
//This parser will then strip the attributes given in the command string into a key-value map with the prefix, `p/` as the key and `validSpending.csv` as the value.

The Import Feature has one main component, which is the `ImportCommand.java` file. This file contains the main logic behind the feature.
The `ImportCommand#readSpendingFromCsv()` method utilises the `FasterXML/jackson` library to read in `.csv` files and convert it into maps of objects.
The maps will then be processed and parsed into `Spending` objects which will be added into a `Spending` list.
Those maps that do not pass the parse conditions will then be thrown as an exception and its message will be saved inside an error list.
After all the maps are processed, the application will then go through the valid spending list and save them by calling the `Model#addSpending()` method.
Following that, the application will then prints an output, showing the result of the command execution.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an import command:

.Import Feature Activity Diagram
image::importActivityDiagram.png[]

When a user calls the `import` command and inputs a valid `.csv` file, the application will read and parses all the data inside the file and save them to the `SpendingBookList` and `moneygowhere.json`.

==== CSV File Format and Constraints
In order for data to be imported into MoneyGoWhere, it must be in a properly formatted CSV file.
There should be 5 columns specified for `Name`, `Cost`, `Date`, `Tag` and `Remark`

Header Constraints

* The first row is considered a column header and is required.

Cell Formatting

* There should not be any leading and trailing spaces in a cell.
* To specify a comma within a cell, the value of the cell should be inside double quotes. Eg:
** "yummy, juicy"
** "fresh, clean"
* To specify double quotes within a cell, in addition to start and end double quotes, escape the double quote with another double quote. Eg:
** """yummy"", ""juicy"""
** """fresh"", ""clean"""
