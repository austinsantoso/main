== About the Project

MoneyGoWhere is a finance application built by my team and I as part of a Software Engineering Project.
It was morphed from a basic command line interface Address Book.
MoneyGoWhere is designed to help students to keep track of all their spending and their related information such as date, cost and tags.
Notable features include allowing users to set budget goals, view statistics, set reminders for bills and export their data to a .csv file.

=== My Role

My  role was to implement the statistics and graph features which are essential in allowing users analyze their spending habits.
The following sections will illustrate these features in greater detail.
These include the implementation details and also other contributions and relevant sections I have recorded in the User Guide and Developer Guide.

Below are a few icons and formatting which will be used in this document.

[NOTE]

[TIP]

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of contributions I have made for the project.

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented the *statistics feature*.
** What it does: It allows the user to view their spending in the form of a pie-chart which organises the user's expenditure based on tags.
** Justification: This feature enhances the product significantly as it enables users to view their spending in the form of figures which is easier to read than text.
It allows them to be more informed of their spending habits as they will be more aware of what they have spent their money on.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth understanding of the software architecture as it involves multiple components of the application.

* *Minor enhancement*: I implemented the *graph feature*.
** What it does: It allows the user to view their spending in the form of a graph based on a date range provided.
** Justification: This enables the user to easily track their spending by providing an overview of their spending within a specified date range.
** Highlights: This enhancement also required an in-depth understanding of the software architecture as it involves multple components of the application.
